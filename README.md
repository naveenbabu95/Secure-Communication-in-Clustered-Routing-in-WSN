Designed a cluster-based secure routing protocol for wireless senor networks(WSN) for data to be passed from the sensor nodes back to the
base station.
The protocol used ECC based Diô€‚¨e Hellman key exchange protocol to negotiate a symmetric key, to be used for encryption of the data and
used hashing of a secret password set in the nodes for authentication of the node back to the base station.
The timestamp of the message was XORed with the secret password to avoid replay attacks.

Created a simulation for this protocol using OMNeT++ Discrete Event Simulator.
